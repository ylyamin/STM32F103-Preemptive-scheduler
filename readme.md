# STM32F103 Preemptive scheduler

## Overview
This a project with Simple Task Scheduler based an STM32F103 board with ARM® Cortex®-M3 MCU. \
With an intention to help learn the Operating System basises. \
Time-triggered Preemptive round-robin Scheduler with stack switching between already pre-built tasks.

Purely bare-metal embedded-c and register manipulations without using any STM32Cubemx®-generated code, frameworks or HAL libraries. \
It is pain way to learn low level software development. \
For user interaction used UART with a simple Command Line Interface

## Tools:
* OS: Windows 10 x64 
* Code editor and Debbuger: VS code with extensions: Code Runner, Cortex-Debug
* Compiler: GNU GCC  - https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack/releases/tag/v11.2.1-1.2/
* Build automation: GNU Make - https://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm
* Interfaces with JTAG debugger: OpenOCD - https://github.com/openocd-org/openocd/releases/tag/v0.11.0

## Hardware:
* Blue Pill STM32F103C8T6 board (Arm® 32-bit Cortex®-M3 CPU core 72MHz, 64Kb Flash, 20Kb SRAM)
* ST-Link V2 Mini - debugger and programmer.
* FTDI FT232RL - USB to UART interface 

## External dependency
* Command Line Interface from project - Embedded CLI https://github.com/funbiscuit/embedded-cli/tree/v0.1.2
* STM32F103C8TX_FLASH.ld, syscalls.c, sysmem.c so far still generated by STM32CubeIDE

## Instalation
* For build use:
```
make all;
```
* For flash and debug use: VS code/Code Runner configured by .vscode/launch.json

## TODO:
- [ ] Re-structure project according C guidelines and best practice
- [ ] Embeedded CLI depends of malloc() from sysmem.c figure out how eliminate this
- [ ] printf() depends of syscalls.c figure out how eliminate this mybe port to nanolib
- [ ] Led seems configured not fully properly
- [ ] Figure out how to use BOOT jumper
- [ ] Embedded cli library - do it as git submodule
